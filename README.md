# Blockchains and the Music Industry

I've spent a good part of the last year working with and thinking about blockchains, and I just spent a solid week at SXSW talking to people of all sorts of perspectives within the music industry about how these tools could be beneficial to them.

The fundamental ways that I expect the blockchain to benefit the music industry is actually surprisingly similar to just about every other industry, but probably driven by a specific set of those benefits, because they are the most beneficial features to the existing power structures in the industry.

I'm going to start this article discussing the existing revenue models of the music industry, and how they could be augmented by blockchain technologies. I'm then going to build on those basic tools to demonstrate how powerful they actually are. By the end, I hope to leave you with a couple way-out possible futures, and hopefully a strong enough understanding that you can imagine your own.

### A note on DRM

When talking about publishing intellectual property rights on a blockchain, people inevitably get caught in a specific intellectual eddie that is rooted in the last hundred years of how the industry has operated.

Inevitably someone will say:

> Yeah, but how do you control who can hear it?

The blockchain does not answer that question, and it does not have an opinion on it. Information has a tendency to be freed upon sharing. You can't unlearn that the world is round, and sometimes you can't even voluntarily get a song out of your head.

Computers are no different. Either they receive the information or they don't. If they play the music through the speakers, another could easily capture the sound with a microphone.

The perfect implementation of DRM merely inconveniences piracy, making encouraged channels more appealing.

The solutions I'll discuss do not solve perfect DRM, but they do simplify the process of creating a fair economy for music payments, that listeners can feel good about, artists can be compensated for, and so can everyone providing a valuable service along the way.

## The Current Recording Industry

Let me apologize in advance, I'm not in the recording industry, I've just been talking to its members and attending talks by some of its members for the last week, pretty much nonstop. There are probably inaccuracies in this description, but I believe the general pattern (and in turn, the proposed solution) remains valuable.

The most complicated aspect of how Blockchains will affect the music industry is its interface with the industry's legal arms. Specifically with Publishing Rights Organizations, or PROs.

Currently PROs are the legal entities, technically nonprofits, that are responsible for collecting and distributing royalties among the artists according to their agreed terms and ownerships.

These organizations evoke some mixed feelings in a lot of people. Being a very exclusive six-company industry, it is notoriously hard for new organizations to gain foothold in the field, and they essentially represent the music that can be monetized!

Without joining a PRO, your music never gets on iTunes, Amazon, Netflix, never gets played in an airport, coffee shop, or on a radio station or streaming service.

There's no *legal* reason these places won't play your music if they had your permission, but in a global economy, there is no easy way to personally ask each artist, negotiate terms, and pay a fee before playing their music. In this way, the role of the PRO essentially comes down to communicating terms and prices along the distribution chain, as well as legal enforcement.

A coffee shop pays some license fee for some set of music, maybe from a single PRO, and since that's the only music they *know* they're legally safe to play, it's the only sensible choice for a company trying to keep everything above-board.

If an artist wants to ensure maximal distribution, they might register with multiple PROs. If those PROs register the same song with a typo in the title, it's possible that someone buying the rights to that song later on (say, for a commercial) to end up having to pay the rights twice, just because of an accounting error, where these organizations are simply not perfect at coordinating information between each other.

## Enter the Blockchain

Blockchains are good at sharing public knowledge, and verifying exactly who submitted a particular action or piece of data. It's basically perfect for an intellectual property registry, because everyone who subscribes to the blockchain has a full copy of the entire catalog, in order, and can verify exactly who submitted each entry.

This doesn't replace everything a PRO does. Without legal enforcement, IP rights are meaningless, and so that basic function of a PRO remains intact. Also when an artist has passed, the PRO serves a valuable function of serving their beneficiaries.

What this *does* replace is one very complicated and hard problem that PROs deal with, which is coordinating rights knowledge globally.

There needs to be a public discussion about how these rights should be communicated, and I'm not at all the first person to suggest this. I had the good fortune of getting to speak to Benji Rogers, who has put forth some specific proposals for a useful datatype, and has also opened a call for discussion on what other attributes that data type should include.

I'll probably be chiming into those discussions soon,


The simplest way an artist or their representative could start using the blockchain today would be to simply publish a "hash" (a short fingerprint) of each new song.

There is still a place for actually enforcing royalties, which is a legal task, and represents a real value that artis

PRO as a CA for publishing music rights.



Especially when coupled with their distribution contracts limiting what can be played on streaming services, radios, airports, coffee shops, amazon, netflix, all sorts of spaces in all sorts of countries around the world, the PROs become the gatekeepers to music being not only distributable but really even very monetizable.

While this exclusivity is frustrating to many, it's really impossible to argue that they do play a pretty fundamental role in the web of music payment, which is legal enforcement.

Since intellectual property is a legal construct, as long as it is to be enforced, there will be armies of lawyers and webs of logistics to collect, period. This is the context in which I say the PRO is not going anywhere soon, and they can breathe a sigh of relief when hearing of blockchains, because their place in the world is safe.

That said, blockchains *can* greatly simplify the role of the PRO, and this will probably both make life easier for PROs, as well as making their organizations slightly smaller.



Anything else is simply asking your users to pay, and trusting them to abide by those terms.







Rather than list all the different roles, I'm going to categorize them by their types of ownership in the finished product:

### Direct Owners of the Work

Some people in the production of a song will receive perpetual royalties on that song's sale.


Today the average song you hear on your phone might consist of different people performing each of these roles, and surely more:

 - Composer
 - Songwriter
 - Musician
 - Singer
 - Booking Agent
 - Record Producer
 - Recording Technicians
 - Publishers
 - Record Companies
 - Streaming Services
 - Publisher's Rights Organizations (PROs)



Each of these contributors will generally have their own terms, and I doubt they all take an equity cut of a recording in most cases.
